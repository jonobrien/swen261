- Some fixes post final release were made, failing tests may actually pass
given the changes in maintenance.

- Some documentation may be incomplete or unnecessary, but were required 
per class project requirements, and were included as a 'complete' overview
of what was done by the team over the course of the semester.

- Roles assigned were loosely kept to at points throughout the project, and 
changed dynamically as different sections of the project were implemented or 
more problematic than others, or as requirements changed
